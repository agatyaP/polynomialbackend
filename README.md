* Node.js                                                                
                                                                



## Setup
 In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine.
 
***
* Open the project in your prefered code editor.
* Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
* Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)
                                                                
In the first terminal
***
* cd frontend and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.
                                                                 
```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
 ```
                                                                

                                                                
 In the second terminal
***
* cd server and create a .env file in the root of your server directory.

```                                                               

$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)                                                                
```                                                                
                                                                
                                                                



So we are done and Hurrah!ðŸŽ‰ the app is running.

## Deploying the app to Firebase(Optional)
Now although it's running good in local server but to deploy to firebase we have to make few more changes. Refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jERUGvbudErNCeSZHWUVlb) tutorial for detailed step by step deployment to firebase.
